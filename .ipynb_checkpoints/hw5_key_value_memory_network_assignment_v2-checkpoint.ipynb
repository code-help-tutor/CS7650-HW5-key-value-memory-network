    "# Preamble\n",
    "\n",
    "This mini-project involves working through all the steps of a problem, whereas prior assignments asked you to just implement core functions. We will give you a dataset, but you will also have the opportunity to manipulate the data in ways that you find beneficial to the overall project and to explain why and how those manipulations mattered. This will be in addition to building the model from scratch, developing the training loop, and implementing testing. The code will be accompanied by a report written into the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will have you working with attention mechanism, in a new type of system for question-answering. This will provide you with experience working with attention mechanisms while not directly working with transformers.\n",

    "This assignment is not autograded. You can modify any code cells as long as you achieve the requirements of each graded component."

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory networks learn to access external memory stores (a database or, in the case of this assignment, a dictionary). Key-Value Memory Networks specifically assume that the external memory store is organized as a dictionary with keys and values. In theory memory networks are useful when one wants a neural network to be able to know a lot of information but we don't want to try to encode that information directly into the parameters of the network. This means information can be changed in the external memory database without retraining the neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a question, e.g., \"Where was Alexander Hamilton born?\", a key-value memory network learns an embedding such that the question has a high cosine similarity to a particular key in the external dictionary. Because there are many keys that need to be matched against, key-value memory networks implement an attention-scoring mechanism to select a key. Because attention is a probabilistic score, the key-value memory network retrieves a sum of embeddings weighted according to the attention score. This weighted embedding is then compared to values using a second attention-scoring mechanism. The value with the highest cosine similarity can then be retrieved and returned as the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory networks were an important part of the evolution of question-answering systems that have been eclipsed by transformers. However, the attention mechanism in a key-value memory network is very similar to the self-attention inside a transformer, so implementing a key-value memory network is a really great way to experiment and learn about self-attention without the added complexity of transformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key-value memory networks are also closely related to retieval-based generation networks, except we will be retrieving facts from a dictionary instead of via the internet. However, the embedding of retrieved data will be similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key-value memory networks are described in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03126). It is recommended that you read the paper, but we will also walk through the steps you will need to complete."

    "This [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03126) describes the key-value memory networks in detail, which is also sketched out below.\n",

    "A key-value memory network takes a natural language question. This question will be converted into a bag-of-words (i.e., a multihot) Call this $x$ and it is a 1D tensor of vocabulary length.\n",
    "\n",
    "![KVMemNet architecture](https://github.com/markriedl/kvmemnet-assignment/blob/32479dd1e88a9f8dfc72f11ccb8e9e0e1f78905f/kvmemnet-inside.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "The KVMemNet will contain a linear layer (or embedding layer) that will produce a 1D embedding of the question $q=A(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The KVMemNet will also take in a stack of keys as a tensor of shape `num_keys x vocab_size`. Each row is embedded using the same embedding, $k=A(keys)$, producing a tensor of shape `num_keys x embed_dim`. How this stack of keys is chosen will be discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The KVMemNet will take in a third input, a stack of values associated with the stack of keys. This will also be of shape `num_values x vocab_size`. Each row is embedded using the same embedding, $v=A(values)$, producing a tensor of shape `num_keys x embed_dim`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The KVMemNet will also contain a second linear embedding layer, $B$. More on this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have `q`, `k`, and `v` embeddings, the next step is to use `q` and `k` to compute attention scores that can be applied against `v`. Think of $A$ as learning how to make questions and the keys that should match against values that have received the same treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention scores `p` are computed by taking the inner-product (`torch.inner()`) between `q` and `k`. The result will be a 1D tensor with `num_keys` length. Use softmax so that `p` contains scores between 1.0 and 0.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering why there isn't a non-linearity such as a sigmoid or ReLU after the linear layer. Softmax is a non-linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next apply the `p` attention scores against `v` to apply a weight against each value in the stack of values. One should be highly weighted and the rest less weighted. Sum all the weighted values up to create a 1D tensor `o` of feature weights of length `embed_dim`. `p` can be thought of as how much of each value gets selected. Then they all get combined together and the feature weights are proportional to how much each value was attended to. The `torch.matmul()` can do the multiplication and summing in one step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The KVMemNet forward function should return this tensor of feature weights `o`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick note on `k` and `v`. We can't send the entire set of keys and values in our database through the network's forward function. Instead there should be a selection mechanism that selects just a subset of the database. This subset should contain the best key for the question $x$ to match against, and its corresponding value. We assume that a shallow selection process can narrow down the key-value pairs to a relatively small set, one of which will be best. For example, if the question involves \"Alexander Hamilton\", we can reasonably guess that the best key-value pair is in the part of the database associated with the named person.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are not done though. What about our linear layer $B$? Suppose variable `Y` contains our entire set of values in our databse as bags of words. $B$ is going to be used to embed our entire set of database values $y=B(Y)$. $B$ can be thought of as learning how to make all the values look like the feature weights output by the model such that the highest cosine similarity corresponds to the correct value taken from *all* values in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "$B$ should live inside the KVMemNet object so that its parameters become trainable, but notice that we do not use $B$ in the KVMemNet's forward function. $B$ will get used to prepare the stack of all values in the database for training. It will bet used in the training loop but outside of the forward function. This is a bit unusual, but necessary to figure out the correct target (the true index of the best value to match against) for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above explantion only implements *single-hop* retrieval. *multi-hop* retrieval allows the results of one retrieval to inform a second (and third and so on) to get the right retrieval. This would be used in the case where the answer cannot be inferred directly from the question in a single retrieval, such as \"What was the founding date of the country that Alexander Hamilton was born in?\". To implement multi-hop retrieval, the KVMemNet will have additional linear layers $R_1...R_n$. Each $R_{i}$ will do a linear transform on `q` then attention will score and retrieve values as feature weights `o`. This will be sent to the next $R_{i+1}$ and so on until the hops are complete. This final `o` will be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment is is sufficient to only do *single-hop* retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above explanation does not include consideration of batching. You may want to add a batch dimension as the first dimension and input a batch as a set of questions, a set of stacks of keys, and a set of stacks of values. To do this, functions like `.inner()`, `.mm()`, and`.matmul()` will not work. Instead use `.bmm()` which handles batching correctly. You will probably need to do some `.squeeze()` and `.unsqueeze()` operations to make sure your tensors are the correct shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of bag-of-words, one may also consider first converting each question, key, and value into a general set of embeddings such as [GLoVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). To do this one will need to consider how to combine words--convert each word into an embedding vector and then add the vectors together (or maybe average them)."

    "First, there are no \"questions\". You need to generate questions for each type of relation. There a number of ways to do this. The simplest is to just assume that a question is the name of a person and a relation, e.g., \"Alexander Hamilton birth date\". Another way would be to create templates for each type of relation. For example the \"birth date\" relation would have the following template: \"When was [name] born?\", filling in the [name]. Because there are a lot of different types of relations, you may want to remove the more obscure relations so you need fewer templates and also have a smaller vocabulary. Templates work well if the questions are expected to be almost identical to the templates. You may want to generate multiple templates per relation. Continuing the previous example, a second template would be: \"What is the birthdate of [name]?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are feeling more ambitious, you could use GPT-J, GPT-NeoX, GPT-3 or ChatGPT to generate templates. It works decently well and you can get some variety of templates.\n",

You might just need the ones that are directly associated with the person (Alexander Hamilton has 23). You may need to mix in a few key-value pairs from another person's entries in the database to help ensure against accidental overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final challenge you will have in the training loop is that there may still be too many unique values in `Y` to encode and create one big tensor. In that case, you can at least use the values that you sent to the KVMemNet, along with as many other randomly selected values as you can fit into the GPU's memory."

    " **Q1:** What pre-processing of the data did you do? What motivated the design decisions and how did it impact training and any processing of natural language questions (Parts A and D)?\n",
    "\n",
    " Hint: This should help one understand any code modifications you made in Parts A and the first part of Part D. But you shouldn't use this to document your code (hopefully you commented your code with code comments and text cells above), but to justify your choices as well as to explain what worked and what didn't work.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Q2:** Report on your training on the real data (Part D). Show your loss curve and report on the testing accuracy. There are many ways to implement the training loop, particularly with the choice of keys and values. What decisions did you make when developing your training loop? Justify your decisions. How did they impact the training?\n",
    "\n",
    " Hint: This assignment doesn't grade you on how well your model learns---your solution will not be perfect. We focus more on how you worked through the process. This part of the report should show how well your solution worked, but also the intuition for why it works, and to document the things you tried that didn't work.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Q3:** Describe your technique on how you process natural language questions (Part E). Provide some examples of your technique answering questions correctly and some examples of your technique answering questions incorrectly. Discuss what causes the failure cases.\n",
    "\n",
    " Hint: You are not penalized for incorrectly answered questions---your model will not be perfect---we are looking for honest reflection. Preferably, show the example as code blocks running your model with notebook outputs saved.\n",
    "\n",
    " We have provided three prompts below. You can create as many text and code cells as necessary."
